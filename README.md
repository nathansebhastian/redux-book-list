# Redux Book List

Simple project to learn Redux

###How to Install###
Clone the repo, then open your terminal, change to the project directory, and:

```
	> npm install
	> npm start
```

###What I Learned###
* promote components into containers when they care about the state changes!
* containers = smart components that know about redux states
* React and Redux are two separate monsters (kinda like cyclops and gorgons)
* In real apps, maybe put containers in App class.
